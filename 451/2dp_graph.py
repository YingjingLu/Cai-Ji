Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

Given a graph and a source vertex in the graph, 
find shortest paths from source to all vertices in the given graph.

Starting from one of the vertex, and propagate to all the reachable vertex 

In case to find a specific vertex, stop when finding the target node

Does not work when the graph has negative weight
